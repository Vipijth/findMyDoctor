“FIND MY DOCTOR” is a multi-functional online doctor appointment
scheduling system for doctors, clinics and large hospitals. This open source scheduling
system is built upon PHP. With the ease of configuration and personalization, Find My
Doctor is the best tool for both doctors and patients. This is a powerful medical doctor
appointment scheduling software to meet all challenges that may surface during your
appointment scheduling and hospital management. This online doctor appointment booking
software is user-friendly at both front and back ends, which means that the process of
booking appointments and scheduling management of Find My Doctor is easy for both the
doctors and patients. For attracting new patients, a medical practice must adopt digitization.
By using Find My Doctor, doctors make a start to provide digital healthcare. This is an
internet based system that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments
according to customer’s choice or requirements. The task sometimes becomes very difficult
for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the customer as
per their availability. Hence this project offers an effective solution where customers can
view many booking slots available and select the preferred date and time. The already booked
space will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system also allows
users to cancel their appointment any time. This system provides the power of direct
interaction between doctors of customer choice. It can also maintain list of doctors, available
appointment time, book appointment and cancel appointment.
